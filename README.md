### 👨‍💻

I like keeping things neat with testable, composable code. It's best to break things down to their simplest parts and actions, that's why I'm a huge fan of the functional programming paradigm. Lately I've been getting my hands dirty with React, AWS, and testing while building an application to help guitarists easily write and save guitar tablature.

When I'm not coding you'll find me noodling on my guitar 🎸, training the pup, or at a table playing board games with my people.
