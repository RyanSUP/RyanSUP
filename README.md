### 👨‍💻

I like keeping things neat with testable, composable code. I'm looking forward to gettting my hands dirty with Jest testing, Socket.io and more React. I learned Tailwind by building this site and -- oof -- utility-first CSS is 😙🤌.


You'll also find me noodling on my guitar 🎸, or at a table playing board games with my people.
